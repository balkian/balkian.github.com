Ongoing Projects
================

* `Onyx <http://gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/onyx>`_: an ontology for emotion analysis that includes concepts from W3C's provenance.
* `Marl <http://gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/marl>`_: I updated this ontology, originally created by Adam Westerski, to make it compatible with the W3C's provenance ontology.


Past Projects
=============

* `Hermes <http://github.com/balkian/hermes>`_: one of my first projects, developed together with David PÃ©rez as the special custom assignment in one of our courses. Hermes is an affective bot designed to mimic the behavour of humans. It included a plug-in system for its sensors and actuators. The information from its sensors changed its emotional state, which was shown via its actuators. Among others, it could fetch inforation from Twitter or its host system and change the expressions of an external Face made with servo motors or speak via its Text-To-Speech software. For instance, it could detect it was running out of battery, showing a sad face and sending an alerting tweet. You can see it in action in these two youtube videos: `Part 1 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnEYahPD9z4>`_ and `Part 2 <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQZldCTPEJc>`_.
* `EESTEC.net <http://github.com/eestec/eestec.portal>`_: the Plone based official portal of EESTEC. I fixed some bugs and implemented basic features. It's still an ongoing project.
* `Maia <http://github.com/gsi-upm/maia>`_: the Modular Architecture for Intelligent Agents is an evented agent architecture that aims to update the classical frameworks for intelligent agents with the concepts emerged from the Live Web.
