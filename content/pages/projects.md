Past Projects
=============
 * [Hermes](http://github.com/balkian/hermes): one of my first projects, developed together with [David PÃ©rez](cathan) as the special custom assignment in one of our courses. Hermes is an affective bot designed to mimic the behavour of humans. It included a plug-in system for its sensors and actuators. The information from its sensors changed its emotional state, which was shown via its actuators. Among others, it could fetch inforation from Twitter or its host system and change the expressions of an external Face made with servo motors or speak via its Text-To-Speech software. For instance, it could detect it was running out of battery, showing a sad face and sending an alerting tweet. You can see it in action in these two youtube videos: [Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnEYahPD9z4) and [Part 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQZldCTPEJc)
