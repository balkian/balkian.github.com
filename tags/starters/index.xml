I have settled
for github-pages because I like the idea of keeping my site in a
repository and having someone else host and deploy it for me. The site
will be really simple, mostly static files. Thanks to Github,
&lt;a class="link" href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jekyll&lt;/a> will automatically generate static pages
for my posts every time I commit anything new to this repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But Jekyll can be used independently, so if I ever choose to host the
site myself, I can do it quite easily. Another thing that I liked about
this approach is that the generated html files can be used in the
future, and I will not need Jekyll to serve it. Jekyll is really simple
and most of the things are written in plain html. That means that
everything could be easily reused if I ever choose to change to another
blogging framework (e.g. pelical). But, for the time being, I like the
fact that Github takes care of the compilation as well, so I can simply
modify or add files through the web interface should I need to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hadn&amp;rsquo;t played with HTML and CSS for a while now, so I also wanted to
use this site as a playground. At some point, I realised I was doing
mostly everything in plain HTML and CSS, and decided to keep it like
that for as long as possible. As of this writing, I haven&amp;rsquo;t included
any Javascript code in the page. Probably I will use some to add my
&lt;a class="link" href="http://gist.github.com/balkian" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>gists&lt;/a> and
&lt;a class="link" href="http://github.com/balkian" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>repositories&lt;/a>, but we will see about that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the code speaks for itself, so you can check out &lt;a class="link" href="http://github.com/balkian/balkian.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my repository
on Github&lt;/a>. You can clone
and deploy it easily like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">git clone
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">https://github.com/balkian/balkian.github.com &lt;span class="nb">cd&lt;/span> balkian.github.com
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">jekyll serve -w
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I will keep updating this post with information about:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Some Jekyll plugins that might be useful&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What CSS tricks I learnt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The webfonts I used&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The badge on the left side of the page&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item></channel></rss>
