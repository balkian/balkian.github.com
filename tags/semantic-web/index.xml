And, to be honest, I&amp;rsquo;ve grown increasingly dissatisfied with the field.
To the point where I dread having to work on it.
Some day I will write about it in length, but today I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled upon a post that covers the topic quite well: &lt;a class="link" href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/the-semantic-web-is-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Semantic Web is Dead - &lt;del>Long Live the Semantic Web&lt;/del>&lt;/a> (styling mine).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In particular, this section has really resonated with me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="note">&lt;h1 id="academics-and-industry">Academics and Industry
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The political economy of academia and its interaction with industry is the origin of our current lack of a functional Semantic Web.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Academia is structured in a way that there is very little incentive for anyone to build usable software. Instead, you are elevated for rapidly throwing together an idea, a tiny proof of concept, and to iterate on microscopic variations of this thing to produce as many papers as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In engineering, the devil is in the detail. You really need to get into the weeds before you can know what the right thing to do is. This is simultaneously a devastating situation for industry and academia. Nobody is going to wait around for a team of engineers to finish building a system to write about it in Academia. You’ll be passed immediately by legions of paper pushers. And in industry, you can’t just be mucking about with a system that you might have to throw away.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote></description></item></channel></rss>
